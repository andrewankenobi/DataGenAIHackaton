        "Google's Environmental Report 2022 details the company's progress in reducing its environmental impact. Google has been carbon neutral for its operations since 2007 and has matched 100% of its annual electricity use with renewable energy for five consecutive years. The company is working towards a carbon-free and circular economy, and has set goals to achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030, become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24/7, enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy, and help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually. Google is also committed to helping 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through its core products.\n"
